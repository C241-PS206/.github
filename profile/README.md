# 🌱🌿 AgroVision: Empowering farmers with plant disease detection on the go 🌱🌿

Welcome to AgroVision, an android based app designed to help indonesian farmers in solving pest and diseases problem and reach out others to talk about their agricultural concerns.

Our app is capable of detecting common Indonesian crops (i.e. rice, cassava, corn, cane) of 19 different diseases. A detailed explanation on the model performance is documented on the [ML-notebooks](https://github.com/C241-PS206/ML-notebooks) repository.
